/**
 * PlatPursuit.Games.Driver.Ship
 *
 * Ship physics and rendering for Stellar Circuit.
 * Implements thrust-based space physics: the ship has a rear thruster,
 * rotates to aim, and momentum carries it through space.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Thrust-based movement (velocity vector, not steering)
 * - Rotation control
 * - Drag model (on-track vs off-track)
 * - Boost pad response
 * - Geometric ship rendering with neon glow
 * - Particle systems (engine trail, retro-thrust, off-track sparks)
